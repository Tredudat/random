# Trenton Henderson's First Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal website! I'm Trent, a passionate and creative US Navy Veteran and Computer Science student at Park University. This website is a canvas for my technical journey, showcasing projects, ideas, and milestones as I explore the world of software development.

## What's Inside?

The website is structured to provide visitors with a glimpse into what I do and who I am:

- **Home**: A welcome message and a brief introduction to my site.
- **Updates on Future Projects**: A blog-style section where I post about ongoing and upcoming projects or ideas I'm exploring.
- **About Me**: A more personal look at my journey, my goals, and the story behind my passion for technology.

Each project update will include:
- Rich descriptions of the project's purpose and my approach.
- Images and screenshots to visualize the concepts and progress.
- Links to additional resources and my social media for further discussion and collaboration.
